### Hello Traveler 🌌

My name is <b>Nikita</b>. I am a lazy front-end developer.
I'm from Ukraine, I like to code static web pages. 
Still learning HTML, CSS, JS. Angry Python is not friends with me.

I like drinking red tea, painting with watercolors, and walking in the forest.

### My Photos with nature 🕊️

In my spare time, I like to take pictures of everything I see around me. And now I want to share these photos with you
